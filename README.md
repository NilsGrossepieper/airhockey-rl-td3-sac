# AirHockey RL â€” TD3 & SAC

![TD3 self-play](docs/td3_demo.gif)  
*TD3 self-play (TD3 agent vs TD3 agent).*

Train two reinforcement learning agentsâ€”**TD3** and **SAC**â€”to master a continuous-control **AirHockey** environment.  
This repo contains training scripts, demo notebooks, and experiment results.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What this is
- Reinforcement learning environment for Airhockey
- Training scripts for TD3 and SAC magents  
- Quick demo notebook to render the environment  
- Presentation with experimentation results (see **docs/**)  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What it does
- Trains **TD3** and **SAC** agents on the same AirHockey game  
- Lets you easily tweak hyperparameters (e.g., policy noise, policy delay)  
- (Optional) Logs training runs to **Weights & Biases** for tracking
